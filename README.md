## About
my name is Ifunanya, i have a bachelor of science degree in education(Adult education/Ecomomics and statistics)
I worked as an instore sales promoter for a mobile phone manufacturer(1 year), marketing and selling the flagship devices.
I later worked with same company as a retail consultant(8 years), growing the market share and share of recommendation of the devices.
I got into networking and multi-level marketing for two years, then moved on to work as a wealth advisory consultant with a real estate and investment company.
As a very empathetic person ,passionate about providing solutions to the needs of people, i started looking into the area of IT as a more modern and dynamic way of solving issues.
Digital witch consulting exposed me to the vast world of IT. Though i had previously worked with mobile devices, my knowledge was limited to using the devices,troubleshooting,
knowledge of the features,and so on. i didnt really get to see what happens at the backend.
I picked interest in IT support and completed the google IT support specialist coursee, which was an eight month intensive course covering IT fundamentals,networking,
system administration,cyber security. I wanted to have afeel for different areas in IT so i could find the best fit.
I did a three month training program with Zuri on product design where i designed an agricultural app aimed at encouraging youths to go into agriculture, provide support
and solutions for those already actively involved in agriculture and i was put  in a team  of coders and designers that built a feedback generation form website as our final project.
I have always loved patterns, tried to understand them and use thpse patterns to predict, so i took a 6 month course with Hertechtrail on Data analytics. i took the starter course ( 3 months)
and did my capstone project which involved using progresql( writing queries and subqueries to get needed information) and a dashbord visualization with power Bi.
For the pro course,my capstone project was analysis and visualization of draky supremarket using python.
I believe data analytics resonates with me and am open to accepting an internship or entry level position that will give me access to real time data and help improve my knowledge and skill.
